The flame doesn't have a gyro, so the compass has to suffice. The magnetic switch in cardboard doesn't play nice with the compass.

I'm planning to stop using the compass altogether once orientation events are consistent enough to use head tilting to move around. See the bug at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1176801
